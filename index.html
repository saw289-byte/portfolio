    A Proposition - Reflection

   <p style="text-decoration:none;font-family:W95FA;color:blue">
     My creative practice centers around transforming personal narratives—stories of joy, sorrow, heritage, aspirations, and imagination-into visual experiences that connect on an emotional level. I primarily work across painting, drawing, design, and digital media, often using vibrant, unconventional color palettes that move away from realism to create symbolic depth and intrigue. Inspired by both the vibrancy of my Mexican heritage and the nostalgic aesthetic of early internet culture, my work invites viewers into emotionally rich and symbolically layered worlds.

      In my process, intuition and critical self-assessment play huge roles. I have a strong ability to sense when a piece feels "off," which allows me to continually refine and elevate my work. I much like the design studio Schoooool, prioritize research, and concepts in my design . In terms of executing the concepts, versatility is key to my approach; I use a broad range of materials and am committed to expanding my digital skill set to better realize complex visual ideas. Mastery of industry-standard design software is something I’m actively working toward, understanding that a stronger grasp of digital tools will open up new possibilities for creative expression.

   Computation, for me, is both a challenge and a catalyst. While traditional methods feel natural, the digital realm demands new skills as it offers incredible opportunities. Tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and even coding environments can extend my ability to tell stories visually. I’m particularly intrigued by how the "primitive" aesthetics of early web design, such as Windows 98 interfaces, clunky animations, and pixel art, can be reinterpreted today. The Webcore movement, which embraces nostalgic internet visuals through GIFs, clip-art, and DIY aesthetics, has been especially influential. It shows how computation can not only complement but also expand the emotional and cultural resonance of visual storytelling.

      That said, I also sometimes feel alienated by the precision and coldness often associated with digital work, which can seem at odds with the personal, imperfect humanity I want to convey. In this tension, however, lies creative potential, a space where computation and hand-crafted sensibility can meet in unexpected ways.
